# Chef-Strikes-Backüçîü•§
Welcome to Chef-Strikes-Back, a fast-paced 2D hack-and-slash game where cooking, chaos, and combat come together! Serve food, manage customer moods, and fight off angry patrons in this unique blend of cooking and action.

## üéÆ Gameplay
In Chef-Strikes-Back, you‚Äôre a chef trying to keep up with a high-demand kitchen. Customers are hungry, and you have two ways to serve them:

Deliver food directly to each customer (the old-fashioned way).
Throw food at customers from a distance to feed them faster! Just aim and let it fly.
But beware! Not every customer has the patience to wait. If they get too impatient, they‚Äôll become hostile and try to attack you. Defend yourself with your cooking tools, and keep your kitchen under control!
